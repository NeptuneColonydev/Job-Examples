# Job-Examples
Repository with some examples for potential employers.


I have other repositories, feel free to have a look at those as well. The repositories for both whitecat and blackcat are not real programming  languages and where created for a game called GMod in which there was an ingame scripting language called MaxNet, these repositories should have good descriptions as they were intended to be used by other players.

These repositories are also my "proudest" repositories as I was able to freely create programs that could be used by other players and needed to be feature rich and blackcat also has a manual so users could use it easier.

Ontop of software development I have also built 2 of my own PC's and have also repaired my own laptops. I have experience with both Windows and Linux and how to install both of the operating systems to computers.
