# Job-Examples
Repository with some examples for potential employers.


I have other repositories, feel free to have a look at those as well. The repositories for both whitecat and blackcat are not real programming  languages and where created for a game called GMod in which there was an ingame scripting language called MaxNet, these repositories should have good descriptions as they were intended to be used by other players.
